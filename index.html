            <p>We strive to provide a collaborative, competition-based opportunity for high school students interested in applications of science, technology, engineering, and business through FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). We aim to impact the student body by giving them the opportunity to learn and gain practical skills in leadership and teamwork at Judge Memorial Catholic High School (JMCHS) and we welcome students from nearby schools who do not have a FRC team.</p>
            <p>JudgeMent Call robotics is a student-run team, supervised by teachers, community members, and professionals from industry, where successes and lessons learned come with the understanding that the students are ultimately responsible for the team’s accomplishments. This is a sport for the mind and as we like to say, “It’s the hardest fun you will ever have.”</p>
            <br>
            <h2 class="header">FRC</h2>
            <p>FIRST is an international organization started in 1994 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers with the intent to inspire high school students to become science and technology leaders. Teams are given a unique set of tasks for competition each year and have eight weeks to go from prototype to final product. Teams travel to various district or regional competitions for the chance to qualify for championships.</p>
            <p>FIRST mottoes include “Coopertition,” and “Gracious Professionalism.” These remind and encourage students to be their best selves and to be kind competitors in a professional fashion.</p>
